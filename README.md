# Restaurant-UI-UX-Project


This project is a UI/UX design prototype for a hypothetical restaurant, created as part of my portfolio. It is designed to showcase my skills in user interface and user experience design, with a focus on creating an intuitive, visually appealing interface that provides a seamless experience for the user.

The design includes several key features, including:

Home page with an attractive hero image and clear call-to-action buttons to make reservations or view the menu.
Interactive menu with detailed descriptions of each item, including images and nutritional information.
Reservation system with a simple form to enter date, time, party size, and contact information.
About Us page with a brief history of the restaurant and its mission statement.
Contact page with a form for inquiries and a map with directions to the restaurant.
The design is optimized for desktop and mobile devices, and uses modern design trends to create a sleek, contemporary look and feel. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be easily customized or extended to fit the needs of any restaurant.

I hope you find this project informative and inspiring. Please feel free to fork the repository and use it as a starting point for your own projects. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!
